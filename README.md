# Code underlying my EMF adapter tutorial

This is an example application, 
demonstrating the use of hand-written adapters with the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF).
To use this code you need Eclipse with Modelling Tools.

After importing the project in this repository into your workspace, 
you can start the class `app/TicTacToe` to run the application.
If you don't want to clutter your workspace,
you can start Eclipse with the root folder of this repository as workspace.

If you want to follow along with the tutorial,
check out the tag for the first step as follows:

    git checkout -b step1 step1-static-methods-v1

This will create a new branch `step1` that you can use to track your own development.
